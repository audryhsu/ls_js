You are given array of integers, your task will be to count all pairs in that array and return their count.

Notes:

Array can be empty or contain only one value; in this case return 0
If there are more pairs of a certain number, count each pair only once. E.g.: for [0, 0, 0, 0] the return value is 2 (= 2 pairs of 0s)
Random tests: maximum array length is 1000, range of values in array is between 0 and 1000

// input -- array of integers
// output -- a number

// count all pairs in array

// pair is when a number appears twice in the array.
// if a number appears four times, that counts as two pairs
// loop through the array

// look at first element of array. if the rest of the array includes that number
then increment pair




Examples
[1, 2, 5, 6, 5, 2]  -->  2
...because there are 2 pairs: 2 and 5

[1, 2, 2, 20, 6, 20, 2, 6, 2]  -->  4
...because there are 4 pairs: 2, 20, 6 and 2 (again)
